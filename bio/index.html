            <p> I will try to briefly tell you my story without boring you too much...
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born in Rome, Italy in 1985 and now I live in Sora (FR). Since I was a child I was attracted
                by
                technology, I was fascinated by automatisms, so in choosing which high school to attend, the most
                obvious decision for me was the technical institute with a specialization in computer science. I was
                thrilled by what I could create, by the automatisms and interactions triggered by simple inputs.
            </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I already knew that after school, the family business awaited me (and it had nothing
                to do
                with computers). In order not to forget what I had learned, I started practicing on my own with my
                computer, I also developed a small management software for the family business for fun, but
                obviously my
                project could not replace a management software paid thousands of euros and that the staff
                already knew how to use. Seeing that my commitment was not appreciated and not knowing where to
                direct
                it, I stopped practicing and resigned myself to the idea that my future would lie in that company,
                until
                about eight years later when I decided to take other paths.
            </p>

        <div class="d-flex">
            <div>
                <p>
                    By now what I had studied was obsolete, and in any case, even looking back
                    at the books, I remembered almost nothing. It seemed to me that I had "missed the train", and I
                    began to
                    carry out the most disparate jobs, but inside of me I knew that I still had the
                    passion and predisposition for technology, and that I was wasting time and energy on activities
                    jobs
                    that I didn't like and didn't reward me. Even those who know me well knew it, so they started
                    encouraging me to go back to computer science.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-5">
                    In 2023 I finally decided to upgrade with current web
                    development technologies, and I chose Start2Impact University for that purpose. Today I am
                    determined to
                    put my knowledge at the service of others and to do what I like most.</p>
